# Crop_Prediction_Model
I developed a Crop Prediction System using Python and machine learning techniques to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions about suitable crop selection. The primary goal of the project was to recommend the most appropriate crop based on key environmental parameters such as soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. This system aimed to increase agricultural efficiency and optimize yield by aligning crop choices with local climatic and soil conditions.

To begin, I collected and cleaned agricultural datasets that included both environmental data and corresponding crop outcomes. I designed and implemented a data preprocessing pipeline using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables. This step was essential to ensure the quality and consistency of data fed into the machine learning models.

I trained multiple classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, to identify the most accurate algorithm for crop recommendation. After tuning hyperparameters and evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, the Random Forest model achieved the best results with a prediction accuracy of 92% on the test dataset.

The final model was tested using unseen data to verify its performance and reliability. This project not only provided a practical solution to a real-world agricultural problem but also strengthened my skills in Python programming, machine learning workflows, model evaluation, and domain-specific application of data science.

Overall, the Crop Prediction System project enhanced my ability to apply theoretical concepts in a meaningful way and deepened my understanding of how data science and technology can directly benefit farmers by supporting better crop planning and resource management.
